# Changelog

## 0.0.0-lab.3

- Unified published protocol validation on JSON Schema 2020-12 via Ajv.
- Replaced implicit `$steps.*` / `$inputs.*` string bindings with explicit `{ "$ref": "..." }` binding objects.
- Added `template-value.v0` public schema.
- Added singleton managed-service lock per runtime home.
- Made `start` idempotent and prevented a second managed service when identity is uncertain.
- Made `stop` refuse to kill unverified PIDs; `--force` only SIGKILLs a verified runtime.
- Fixed fixed-command timeout/output overflow so the child is terminated before the error returns.
- Extended file protection to block symlink aliases that resolve to protected files.
- Added protocol, lifecycle and hardening regression tests.
- Kept caller token/JWT authentication out of the current lab scope.
